## Terminal settings

Copy the "profile", "colors.sh" and "git-prompt.sh" files to home directory and rename them so they are hidden (i.e. start with a dot [.] ).

Install the desired theme in Terminal.app.

- profile: Contains the selections for the prompt, colors and some aliases.
- git-prompt.sh: Script for showing the current branch when in a Git repository.
- colors.sh: Defines named colors for easy use in custom terminal prompt.
- emmakun.terminal: Configurations for the Terminal.app.
- Dark.terminal: Dark theme for Terminal.app.
- Light.terminal: Clear theme for Terminal.app.
