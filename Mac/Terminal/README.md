## Terminal settings

Copy the "profile" and "git-completion.bash" files to home directory and rename them so they are hidden (i.e. start with w dot).

- profile: Contains the selections for the prompt, colors and some aliases.
- git-completion.bash: Script for showing the current branch when in a Git repository.
- emmakun.terminal: Configurations for the Terminal.app.
